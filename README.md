## Python scripts

Based on the thesis needs, this project focuses on the following atmospheric gases and parameters of Sentinel-5p: CH4,CO,NO2,SO2,HCHO,aerosol_index,cloud_fraction (aerosol_height was exported but not used in the atmospheric analysis). All the atmospheric data were downloaded using Google Earth Engine, hence
